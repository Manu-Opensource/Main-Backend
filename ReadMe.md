## Main Backend for the AP Self Study Project

This is the main backend made using NodeJS, Typescript, and ExpressJS

This acts as a layer between the CMS and the Frontend, as the CMS is a pain to work with.

Eventually, I may migrate the CMS into here, as having it seperate is a major hinderance to development and design.

This is still a very early WIP, with most features not yet working.

The project is open source under the GNU General Public License.

## The AP Self Study Project

The AP Self Study Project is an under development a website containing resources and lessons for people to self study AP courses.

An AP course is a college level course oppered to high school students in the United states, and although it is tough, it is possible to self study these courses. This website aims to be a central hub for self studying AP courses.
