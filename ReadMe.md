## Main Backend for a website based around self studying AP Courses.

This is the main backend made using NodeJS, Typescript, and ExpressJS

This acts as a layer between the CMS and the Frontend, as the CMS is a pain to work with.

Eventually, I may migrate the CMS into here, as having it seperate is a major hinderance to development and design.

This is still a very early WIP, with most features not yet working.

The project is open source under the GNU General Public License.
