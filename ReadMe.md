## Main Backend for the Manu Project

This is the main backend made using NodeJS, Typescript, and ExpressJS

This acts as a layer between the CMS and the Frontend, as the CMS is a pain to work with.

Eventually, I may migrate the CMS into here, as having it seperate is a major hinderance to development and design.

This is still a very early WIP, with most features not yet working.

The project is open source under the GNU General Public License.

## The Manu Project

Manu, being latin for 'By the hand' is mean to be a platform for learning coding in a hands-on manner.

The general idea is that one can follow a course, which is comprised of lessons which are to be read, and then completeing the challenge at the end of each lesson.

The project is a heavy WIP, and development is slow because I am unable to dedicate much time to coding due to school and studying.
